Measurements
The features selected for this data set come from the accelerometer and gyroscope (denoted as 'Accelerator and 'Gyroscope' in the measurement names respectively)
readings from smartphones attached to test subjects.

In addition the components of the measurment namesare as follows: 
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
'time' reflects the time domain signals.
'frequency' refelects the frequency domain signals. 
The acceleration signal is separated into 'Body' and 'Gravity' signals. 
Body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain 'Jerk' signals
'Magnitude' reflects the calculated magnitude of signals.

The mean ('mean') and standard deviation ('std') is presented for each variable.
